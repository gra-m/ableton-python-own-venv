B12 duration is correct but higher bpm results in slower melody
change factor to / fixes but then check melody duration.

Next step = to clarify print bar durations?
expected note durations note that sleep_durations to fill beat
are only 1.0 or 0.5, but, have not investigated anything fully 
yet. Chances are all fixed in next vid, but interesting to understand 
better..
